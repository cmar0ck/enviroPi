# enviroPi

Project to monitor (and improve) plant growth with a Raspberry Pi, using Pimoroni's [Enviro Phat](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/enviro-phat), optional components like a hygrometer (to measure soil humidity and to know when it's time to water the plants) and a Raspberry Pi Camera. 

**Key features:**

Writes sensor data (like brightness, light color, heading, temperature, pressure, moisture, etc.) to a database and captures timelapse of plant growth. 

Displays sensor data in webinterface (unfinished, feel free to contribute).

**Examples:**
